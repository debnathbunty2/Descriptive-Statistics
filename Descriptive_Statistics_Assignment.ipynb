        "Why is the median a better measure than the mean in this case? Calculate the median\n",
        "\n",
        "- The median is a better measure than the mean in this case because the data set includes an outlier (\\$50,000\\) which significantly skews the mean value, making it an unrepresentative measure of the typical car price. The median, being the middle value of an ordered data set, is resistant to extreme values and thus provides a more accurate representation of the central tendency.\n",

        "Explanation:\n",
        "Consistency in data refers to how close the data points are to the mean or average value. Variance is a measure of the spread or dispersion of data points from the mean. A lower variance indicates that the data points are clustered more closely around the mean, implying greater consistency.\n",
        "In this case:\n",
        "Company A has a variance of 6.\n",
        "Company B has a variance of 15.\n",
        "Since Company A has a lower variance (6 is less than 15), its delivery delays are less spread out and closer to the average delay time compared to Company B. Therefore, Company A provides a more consistent delivery service.\n",

        "\n",
        " - Coin B is riskier to invest in.\n",
        "Standard deviation is a measure of how much the daily price of an asset varies from its average price. A higher standard deviation indicates greater volatility and price fluctuations. Therefore, Coin B, with a standard deviation of $120, has a wider range of potential price changes than Coin A, which has a standard deviation of $30. This makes Coin B the riskier investment.\n",
